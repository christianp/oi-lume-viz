  - title: "Colour using a defined scale"
    description: |
      In this example we've <a href="https://open-innovations.github.io/traffic-growth/data/leeds/cycle-100642-1.csv">processed</a> a <a href="https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/leeds-annual-cycle-growth-">dataset from Data Mill North</a> to find the total daily counts for the St Peters Street (Lane 1) cycle counter in Leeds. We set the `value` of each day to the `Counts` field in the data and then colour each day using a defined colour `scale` (`Viridis`). If `min` and `max` are not set, the scale will use the range in the data.
    config:
      data: test.data.cycle-100643-1
      value: Counts
      key: Date
      scale: Viridis
  - title: "Add a tooltip"
    description: |
      Create virtual `columns` and use one as a `tooltip`.
    config:
      data: test.data.cycle-100643-1
      value: Counts
      key: Date
      scale: Viridis
      columns:
        - name: Tooltip
          template: "{{ Date }} <br />{{ Counts }} counts"
      tooltip: Tooltip
  - title: "Reverse the order of the years"
    description: |
      We can set the `order` of the years to either `chronological` (earliest year first) or `reverse` (latest year first).
    config:
      data: test.data.cycle-100643-1
      value: Counts
      key: Date
      scale: Viridis
      order: reverse
  - title: "Set the first day of the week"
    description: |
      By default we start the week on a Monday but sometimes you may want to use a different day. You can set the `startofweek` value to `0` for Sunday, `1` for Monday etc. Let's start the week on a Sunday.
    config:
      data: test.data.cycle-100643-1
      value: Counts
      key: Date
      scale: Viridis
      startofweek: 0
