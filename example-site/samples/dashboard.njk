  - title: "Simple panels"
    description: |
      This basic example shows four panels. Each has a `title` (set to the `Title` column), a `value` (set to the `Value` column), and is given the default background colour. We only show panels for specified items in the data, not every row. The order of <code>panels</code> is the order they will appear on the page and doesn't have to match the order in the <code>data</code>.
    config:
      title: Title
      value: Value
      data:
        - Title: "Thing 1"
          Value: 15
        - Title: "Thing 2"
          Value: 132
        - Title: "Thing 3"
          Value: 19
        - Title: "Thing 4"
          Value: 90
        - Title: "Thing 5"
          Value: 56.4
      panels:
        - name: "Thing 1"
        - name: "Thing 3"
        - name: "Thing 2"
        - name: "Thing 4"
  - title: "Add units and notes"
    description: |
      In this example we will add a `note` (set to the column `Footnote`) below the value in panels. We can also augment the displayed values with `units` by adding `prefix` or `postfix`. For the fourth panel we will set the `precision` to "0.1" to force the number to be displayed with one decimal place.
    config:
      title: Title
      value: Value
      note: Footnote
      data:
        - Title: "Thing 1"
          Value: 15
          Footnote: "A note"
          Post: "%"
        - Title: "Thing 2"
          Value: 132
        - Title: "Thing 3"
          Value: 19
          Footnote: "2019"
        - Title: "Thing 4"
          Value: 90
          Footnote: "Jan 2021"
          Pre: "£"
          Post: "k"
        - Title: "Thing 5"
          Value: 56.4
          Footnote: Test
          Post: "%"
      units:
        prefix: Pre
        postfix: Post
      panels:
        - name: "Thing 1"
        - name: "Thing 3"
        - name: "Thing 2"
        - name: "Thing 4"
          precision: 0.1
  - title: "Set the colours of panels"
    description: |
      This example shows four differently coloured panels. Some panels have prefixes or postfixes around the values. We only show panels for specified items in the data. The order of <code>panels</code> is the order they will appear on the page and doesn't have to match the order in the <code>data</code>.
